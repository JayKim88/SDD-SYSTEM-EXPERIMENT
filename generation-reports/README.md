# Generation Reports

This folder contains generation reports for all projects created by the SDD System.

## Purpose

- **History Tracking**: Maintain a record of all generated projects
- **Performance Analysis**: Compare generation times across projects
- **Documentation Archive**: Reference previous generations

## File Naming Convention

```
{project-name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
```

**Examples**:
- `my-money-plan-2026-01-02.md`
- `todo-app-2025-12-30.md`
- `voice-journal-web-2025-12-28.md`

## Report Contents

Each report includes:
- **Phase Timeline**: Execution time for all 10 phases
- **Statistics**: Files generated, technologies used
- **Metrics**: Total duration, file counts, test coverage
- **Technology Stack**: Complete list of dependencies
- **Production Checklist**: Readiness verification

## Usage

### View Latest Reports
```bash
ls -lt generation-reports/ | head -10
```

### Compare Generation Times
```bash
grep "Total Duration" generation-reports/*.md
```

### Search by Project
```bash
ls generation-reports/my-money-plan-*.md
```

## Integration

These reports are automatically created during **Phase 10: Documentation Organization** of the `/generate` command.

**Process**:
1. Generate project with `/generate specs/{spec-file}.md`
2. Complete all 10 phases
3. Phase 10 creates:
   - `output/{project}/docs/GENERATION_SUMMARY.md` (in project)
   - `generation-reports/{project}-{date}.md` (in SDD system)

## Retention

Reports are version controlled with Git to maintain full history.
